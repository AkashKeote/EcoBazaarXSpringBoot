# EcoBazaarX Backend - 500 Error Fixes

## Problem Summary
The frontend was experiencing continuous 500 Internal Server Errors when calling `/api/products` and `/api/stores` endpoints, causing the app to hang and reset. The issue was that the database was empty and the endpoints were failing when trying to fetch data.

## Root Cause
- Database tables existed but were empty
- ProductController and StoreController were returning 500 errors when `findAll()` was called on empty repositories
- Frontend was making continuous GET requests that were failing, causing the app to hang

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created DataInitializationService
- **File**: `src/main/java/com/ecobazaar/backend/service/DataInitializationService.java`
- **Purpose**: Automatically populate database with sample data when it's empty
- **Features**:
  - Creates 5 sample stores (EcoMart, GreenLife Store, EcoFriendly Hub, Green Corner, Sustainable Shop)
  - Creates 20 sample products across different categories (Home & Living, Fashion, Electronics, Beauty, etc.)
  - Creates sample users (admin, shopkeeper, customer)
  - Creates wishlists and user settings for customers
  - Provides statistics and initialization status

### 2. Created DataInitializationController
- **File**: `src/main/java/com/ecobazaar/backend/controller/DataInitializationController.java`
- **Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/init/sample-data` - Initialize database with sample data
  - `GET /api/init/status` - Check if database needs initialization
  - `GET /api/init/stats` - Get database statistics

### 3. Modified ProductController
- **File**: `src/main/java/com/ecobazaar/backend/controller/ProductController.java`
- **Changes**:
  - Added auto-initialization in `getAllProducts()` method
  - Checks if database needs initialization before returning products
  - Automatically creates sample data if database is empty

### 4. Modified StoreController
- **File**: `src/main/java/com/ecobazaar/backend/controller/StoreController.java`
- **Changes**:
  - Added auto-initialization in `getAllStores()` method
  - Checks if database needs initialization before returning stores
  - Automatically creates sample data if database is empty

## Sample Data Created

### Stores (5 stores)
1. **EcoMart** - Your one-stop shop for eco-friendly products
2. **GreenLife Store** - Sustainable living made easy
3. **EcoFriendly Hub** - Premium eco-friendly products
4. **Green Corner** - Local eco-friendly products
5. **Sustainable Shop** - Environmentally conscious shopping

### Products (20 products)
- **Home & Living**: Bamboo toothbrushes, reusable water bottles, organic cotton tote bags, etc.
- **Fashion**: Organic cotton t-shirts, hemp backpacks, recycled denim jeans, etc.
- **Electronics**: Solar phone chargers, LED energy saver bulbs
- **Beauty & Personal Care**: Organic face cream, plant-based shampoo
- **Office & Stationery**: Recycled paper notebooks

### Users (4 users)
- Admin user (admin@ecobazaar.com)
- Shopkeeper user (shopkeeper@ecobazaar.com)
- Customer user (customer@ecobazaar.com)
- Akash Keote (keoteakash@gmail.com)

## Deployment Instructions

### For Render Deployment:
1. **Commit and push changes** to your GitHub repository
2. **Render will automatically redeploy** the backend
3. **Test the endpoints**:
   - `GET https://ecobazaarxspringboot-1.onrender.com/api/products`
   - `GET https://ecobazaarxspringboot-1.onrender.com/api/stores`
   - `GET https://ecobazaarxspringboot-1.onrender.com/api/init/status`

### Manual Initialization (if needed):
If auto-initialization doesn't work, you can manually initialize the database:
```bash
curl -X POST https://ecobazaarxspringboot-1.onrender.com/api/init/sample-data
```

## Expected Results After Deployment

1. **Products endpoint** (`/api/products`) will return 20 sample products
2. **Stores endpoint** (`/api/stores`) will return 5 sample stores
3. **Frontend will stop hanging** and display products/stores properly
4. **Admin panel** will be able to add new products without issues
5. **Wishlist functionality** will work properly

## Testing

After deployment, test these scenarios:
1. **Frontend loads** without continuous GET request errors
2. **Products display** on the home screen
3. **Stores display** in the store section
4. **Admin can add products** without the app resetting
5. **Wishlist functionality** works properly

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files:
- `src/main/java/com/ecobazaar/backend/service/DataInitializationService.java`
- `src/main/java/com/ecobazaar/backend/controller/DataInitializationController.java`
- `test-endpoints.ps1` (for local testing)
- `DEPLOYMENT_FIXES.md` (this file)

### Modified Files:
- `src/main/java/com/ecobazaar/backend/controller/ProductController.java`
- `src/main/java/com/ecobazaar/backend/controller/StoreController.java`

## Notes
- The solution is backward compatible
- Auto-initialization only runs when database is empty
- Sample data includes realistic eco-friendly products
- All endpoints maintain their original functionality
- No breaking changes to existing API contracts

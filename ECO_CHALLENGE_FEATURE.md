## Sample Data

The system includes 10 pre-configured eco challenges:

1. **30-Day Plastic Free Challenge** (100 points, 30 days, Sustainability)
2. **Energy Saving Challenge** (75 points, 14 days, Energy)
3. **Zero Waste Week** (50 points, 7 days, Waste Reduction)
4. **Plant-Based Diet Challenge** (80 points, 21 days, Food & Diet)
5. **Water Conservation Challenge** (60 points, 14 days, Water Conservation)
6. **Sustainable Transportation** (90 points, 30 days, Transportation)
7. **Digital Detox Challenge** (40 points, 7 days, Lifestyle)
8. **Local Shopping Challenge** (70 points, 14 days, Shopping)
9. **Green Home Challenge** (85 points, 30 days, Home & Living)
10. **Ocean Cleanup Challenge** (95 points, 21 days, Ocean Conservation)

## Integration with MySQL Database

The eco challenge feature is fully integrated with MySQL database:

- **Database**: MySQL 8.0
- **Connection**: Configured in `application.properties` and `application-prod.properties`
- **JPA**: Uses Hibernate with MySQL8Dialect
- **Auto-creation**: Tables are automatically created with `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update`

## Caching Configuration

Eco challenges are included in the caching system:
- **Cache Names**: `ecoChallenges`, `userChallenges`
- **Cache Type**: Caffeine
- **Configuration**: Maximum 500 entries, expire after 600 seconds

## Frontend Integration

The API endpoints are designed to work seamlessly with frontend applications:

- **CORS**: Configured to allow frontend origins
- **JSON**: All responses are in JSON format
- **RESTful**: Follows REST API conventions
- **Error Handling**: Proper HTTP status codes and error messages

## Testing

A PowerShell test script (`test-eco-challenge-api.ps1`) is provided to test all API endpoints.

## Security Considerations

- Admin endpoints (create, update, delete) should be protected with proper authentication
- User-specific endpoints should validate user ownership
- Input validation is implemented for all endpoints
- SQL injection protection through JPA/Hibernate

## Future Enhancements

1. **Gamification**: Add leaderboards and achievements
2. **Social Features**: Allow users to share progress and invite friends
3. **Notifications**: Send reminders and completion notifications
4. **Analytics**: Track challenge completion rates and user engagement
5. **Custom Challenges**: Allow users to create their own challenges
6. **Rewards System**: Integrate with product discounts and eco points

## Database Migration

The eco challenge feature is automatically initialized when the application starts if no challenges exist in the database. This ensures backward compatibility and easy deployment.

## Performance Considerations

- Database indexes are automatically created on foreign keys
- Caching is implemented for frequently accessed data
- Pagination can be added for large result sets
- Query optimization through JPA repository methods

This eco challenge feature provides a comprehensive foundation for gamifying environmental actions and encouraging sustainable behavior among users.
